# Password Generator Challenge

## Description

This web application features a unique password generator using Javascript. Through this application users are able to generate a unique password. This provides a strong password that is not easy to guess improving security to personal data. The application receives user input through message prompts allowing for the user to select different criteria for their password. These criterias being password standards of uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special character values as well as the ability to choose password length. Through this challenge I was able to familiarize myself with Javascript as a whole, including its functions as well as creating arrays that can be used for random selection among other things.
